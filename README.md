### Hi, I'm Gyasi. 
As a medical doctor with a Master‚Äôs in Public Health and a background as a Data Engineer, I bring a unique combination of clinical insight, population‚Äêhealth expertise, and technical rigor to every project. In my role as a consultant at a medical software company, I leverage my end‚Äëto‚Äëend data engineering skills‚Äîbuilding robust ETL pipelines, designing scalable data models in Snowflake and AWS, and automating workflows‚Äîto transform raw healthcare data into actionable insights.

My fluency in Python, R, SAS, and Rust underpins deep proficiency in data science and AI engineering, and I‚Äôm particularly passionate about applying computer vision to diagnostic imaging and exploring the untapped potential of natural language processing in clinical documentation. Grounded in epidemiology, I approach healthcare challenges at both the patient and population level, identifying disease patterns, optimizing care pathways, and driving data‚Äëdriven public health interventions.

I‚Äôm always seeking new opportunities to meld my medical training, data engineering expertise, and epidemiological perspective‚Äîwhether through consulting, research, or open‚Äësource collaboration‚Äîto improve patient outcomes and advance community health. I look forward to contributing to projects that harness the power of data to innovate in medicine and public health.
