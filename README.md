Hi there! I am a medical doctor with a strong background in data science and artificial intelligence engineering. I have experience working with Python, R, and SAS, and have a particular interest in computer vision. In addition to my technical skills, I also have experience in frontend and backend development. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a data scientist, and am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and make a positive impact. Thank you for visiting my profile.
