### Hi, I'm Gyasi. 
As a medical doctor with a Master's in Public Health, I bring a unique combination of skills and knowledge to the field of medicine. My background in data science, artificial intelligence engineering and epidemiology has allowed me to excel in my role as a consultant at a medical software company. My primary focus is using my technical abilities, medical expertise and epidemiological understanding to improve both clinical and population medicine.

With a strong proficiency in various programming languages such as Python, R, SAS, and Rust, I have a wealth of experience in the field of data science. In particular, I have a keen interest in the application of computer vision in medicine, though I find natural language processing to be a fascinating field as well. My background in public health also allows me to take a population-level approach to improving healthcare, by understanding the patterns, causes and control of diseases in a community.

I am always seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and make a positive impact on the field of medicine. Whether it's through consulting, research or other endeavors, I am dedicated to utilizing my knowledge and expertise to help improve the health and well-being of individuals and communities. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my profile with you and I look forward to future opportunities to make an impact in the field of medicine, particularly in the field of epidemiology.
