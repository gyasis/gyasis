### Hi, I'm Gyasi. 
I am a medical doctor with a Master's in Public Health, and I have a strong background in data science, and artificial intelligence engineering. I am currently consulting at a medical software company, where I use my technical skills and medical knowledge to improve both clinical and population medicine. In particular, I have experience working with Python, R, SAS, and Rust, and have a particular interest in Computer Vision though I find Natural Language Processing to be my secret mistress. My public health background has also allowed me to focus on population-level approaches to improving healthcare, and I am always looking for ways to apply my skills to make a positive impact on medicine. Thank you for visiting my profile.
